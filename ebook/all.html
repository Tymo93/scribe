<h2 id="section-1-today's-internet-users-expect-more-than-ever-before">Section 1: Today’s internet users expect more than ever before</h2>
<p>There is higher standard for what today’s visitors expect from experiences with your business.</p>
<p>But understanding exactly what that is can be a challenge. They’re motivated by different goals. They’re coming from different locations and using different devices. They’re interacting with your business at many different touchpoints and are at different stages along the customer journey.</p>
<blockquote  class="full" >
  <p>We’re maybe as good as a coin-flip at guessing what’s going to work best for our users. People are really fascinating and interesting... and weird! It’s really hard to guess their behaviors accurately.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Best-in class companies like Google, Amazon, and Netflix have set the bar high, providing personalized experiences for shoppers, readers, and internet browsers tailored to their unique preferences.</p>
<div class="callout">
<h4>Best-in-class</h4>

</blockquote>
<p>To stand-out against your ever-growing online competition, you’ll need to provide the best possible experiences because–let’s face it–your customers know they have options. When any one of these experiences doesn’t live up to their expectations, they are likely to bounce to one of many competing sites out there.</p>

<li>84% of online shoppers expect their transaction to take 5 minutes or less</li>
<li>Average pageviews: 4.6</li>
<li><em>Average bounce rate: 40.5%</em>

<p>What exactly do we mean by an “experience” anyway? What experiences are you already providing to customers?</p>
<h3>What is an “experience”?</h3>
<p>An experience is any interaction or touchpoint a user, customer, prospect, or audience member, has with your business.</p>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers visiting product information pages on your site, adding items to their cart, and moving through the checkout - funnel</li>
<li>Users checking out a recent post on your blog</li>
<li>Prospects visiting a landing page after clicking through a display ad in search</li>
<li>Customers opening your monthly newsletter</li>
<li>Customers visiting your brick-and-mortar store</li>
<li>Prospects attending an event hosted by your company</li>
<li>Customer service phone interactions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2-enter-experience-optimization">Section 2: Enter: Experience Optimization</h2>
<p>On average, businesses spend 10-15% of their annual budget on marketing. But...then what?</p>
<p>For every $92 spent on acquiring customers, only $1 is spent on optimization.</p>
<p>Experience optimization is a highly effective way to take those customers and turn them into revenue. With experience optimization, you’ll gather real-time information about your audience and then build experiences tailored to those unique needs and preferences. For most businesses, optimization is a key component to a successful marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Understanding what does and doesn’t work for your customers at each touchpoint will help grow your business, develop lasting customer relationships, and save on valuable time and resources.</p>
<div class="callout">
<h4>The power of iteration:</h4>
<p>Experience optimization is an iterative process. Your audience is constantly growing, changing, and evolving. Optimization allows you to keep tabs on many changing variables and alter course smoothly, so you’re always on top of your game.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout callout--big">
<h3>Optimization in action: Better experiences baked into every customer touchpoint</h3>
<p>To get a better feel for experience optimization, let’s take a look at one company who does it right–HubSpot. HubSpot’s Amanda Sibley explains how they tests various forms of personalization throughout their entire website, and almost all content they post across all marketing channels. According to Amanda, her team puts significant effort behind optimization because they know they’ll see better results in the long run.</p>
<p><em>Smarter content:</em></p>
<p>Tailoring the content and materials on your website to the audience browsing them can have a huge impact. At HubSpot, if we know a visitor is from an enterprise size company, we’ll serve up specific case studies and value props geared towards enterprise-level customers. This personalization shows the visitor that our software is a good fit.</p>
<p>This tactic has helped us achieve a 42% improvement on our calls-to-action.</p>
<p><em>More effective emails:</em></p>
<p>Email marketing is one of the most direct ways to reach your audience, but can also be the biggest turn-off for customers (SPAM ALERT!). That’s why we test all the emails we send.</p>
<p>In a recent series of tests, we experimented with images. (To include images, or not to include images? ...that is the question.) Contrary to what you might think, we found that removing images from our marketing emails actually increased click-throughs by 60%. We’ve since optimized our customer emails accordingly–removing images and focusing on the text our audience prefers.</p>
<p>Other email tests we’ve run have focused on subject line, length, copy positioning, signature/from address, and calls-to-action.</p>
<p><em>Expanded social reach:</em></p>
<p>Based on our findings from the email-image tests, we decided to test the use of images in our tweets as well. This time around, we all believed the image would perform better–it looks more appealing and owns more real estate. Did our Twitter followers agree? Yes!</p>
<p>The tweet with the image saw 36% more clicks, 41% more retweets, 48% more favorites, and 55% more leads generated.</p>
<p><em>More customers:</em></p>
<p>Our blog has millions of viewers each month and is one of the better lead generation channels for our marketing team.</p>
<p>We recently tested two different types of CTAs to see what resonated best with our audience–our original CTA, located at the bottom of each blog post, versus a slide-in CTA located closer to the top of the page. We wanted to understand if a CTA that was “more disruptive” would attract more clicks and convert more leads than the typical bottom-of-the-page button.</p>
<p>Site visitors responded significantly better to the “more disruptive” variation–with a 106% increase in click-throughs and a 38% increase in leads generated. To better serve our visitors (and increase conversions) going forward, we implemented slide-in CTAs on most of our top-performing blog posts.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="section-3-the-strategic-advantages-of-experience-optimization">Section 3: The strategic advantages of experience optimization</h2>
<h3>Advantage #1: Revenue</h3>
<blockquote  class="half" >
  <p>Optimization helped us learn a lot about our users–what’s working and what’s not–so we can make changes on our site to drive conversions. In the end, this translates to higher revenue for us.</p>
  <div class="attribution">— Michael Burk, Senior Online Product Manager, Electronic Arts</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond providing winning customer experiences, optimization delivers lasting value to your business and a huge competitive advantage. Dollar for dollar, no other digital marketing investment provides the same financial leverage.</p>
<p>That’s because experience optimization ups the ROI on everything else you do</p>
<p>If you’re focusing marketing spend on bringing people to your site–through things like SEM, email, social campaigns, and more–why not do everything in your power to maximize the chance to turn those visitors into conversions and dollars? Optimizing the pages you send traffic is an easy way to drive more dollars from your current marketing efforts.</p>
<div class="callout callout--big">
<h3>Top Five Reasons to Invest in Experience Optimization</h3>
<p>Brian Cahak, VP of Business Development at Clearhead, offers five reasons why digital marketing dollars should go toward optimization.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Optimization creates an annuity stream.</em> In contrast to pay-per-click (PPC) investments where marketers must pay for each click, a winning test can yield a sustained benefit far beyond the test duration. This annuity stream can, over time, generate very profitable, disruptive growth, and a very significant return on investment (ROI).</li>
<li><em>Optimization enhances collaboration across departments.</em> Collaboration breeds trust, better communication, and joint problem solving–all the ingredients necessary to design and implement break-through experiences.</li>
<li><em>Optimization is a strategic advantage.</em> Few are doing it well… or at scale. Only 17% of top Alexa ranked sites currently use an optimization platform. 87% of companies who test only run 1-5 experiments per month.</li>
<li><em>Optimization makes an organization more customer focused.</em> No business is wiser than the collective wisdom of their customers.</li>
<li><em>Did I mention the ROI?</em> The cost of optimizing is small when compared to the revenue lift gained from a win. Let’s say you have a $100M e-commerce and improve conversions from 2% to 2.2%. <em>That’s $10M to your top-line revenue. Just from one test.</em></li>
</ol>
<blockquote  class="full" >
  <p>When executed correctly, we’ve seen optimization provide up to 5x more ROI than PPC.</p>
