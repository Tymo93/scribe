<div class="intro">
<p>Stanley Black &amp; Decker is the Fortune 500 company behind industrial tools and household hardware brands including
Black &amp; Decker, Dewalt, Porter Cable, Stanley Tools, and Bostitch. Viget is an Optimizely Solutions Partner, working
with Stanley Black &amp; Decker to make their digital efforts as measurable as possible and to enable better data-driven decisions.</p>
</div>
<p>One way they achieve this is through website optimization. Viget and SB&amp;D have worked together on website
optimization for over three years, including performing tests across the brands’ websites – some of which have led to six-figure impacts in online revenue.</p>
<h2 id="test-1-product-page-cta">TEST 1: PRODUCT PAGE CTA</h2>
<p>One test on Dewalt.com compared two calls-to-action on product pages: the original ‘Buy Now’ CTA versus a variation that read ‘Shop Now.’ The CTA button opened a window containing links to vendors that have the product in stock, such as Lowe’s or Home Depot.</p>
<p>“Some of our team thought “Shop” sounded like a less-committal action, which would compel more site visitors to click the
button,” explains Paul. “Others thought it implied a longer process to purchase.”</p>
<p>They turned to Optimizely to test it out. Paul and his team found that ‘Buy Now’outperformed ‘Shop Now’ – driving 17% more people to click through to the vendor pages.</p>

<p>“Projected over the course of the year, this single decision has a six-figure impact in online revenue, so it’s a good decision to get right,” says Paul.</p>
<blockquote  class="full" >
  <p>There are no universal truths in marketing. The only way we can really figure out what works is through A/B testing.</p>

<h2 id="test-2-homepage-cta">TEST 2: HOMEPAGE CTA</h2>
<p>Another Dewalt call-to-action test aimed to help more people use the site’s functionality to find local retailers. Viget tested three naming differences in the top navigation: ‘Find a Retailer’ (the original version), ‘Where to Buy’ (a more direct option that implied less work for the site visitor), and ‘Nearby Retailers’ (which indicated a physical location).</p>

  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>‘Nearby Retailers’ outperformed both the original and the ‘Where to Buy’ CTAs, sending 4.1% more visitors to use this functionality.</p>
<p>‘Find a Retailer’ and ‘Where to Buy’ could have both related only to online retailers—the winning variation helped clarify this point for visitors.</p>
<h2 id="test-3-product-page-layout">TEST 3: PRODUCT PAGE LAYOUT</h2>
<p>Another test on Black &amp; Decker’s product pages yielded surprising results.</p>
<p>Past UX research had suggested that users commonly scan pages in a ‘Z’ pattern, eventually ending in the lower right-hand corner. Viget wanted to test the validity of the ‘Z’ scanning pattern.</p>
<p>The existing Black &amp; Decker product detail page showed attachments, accessories, and related products in the right rail.</p>
<p>They built an experiment that moved associated products to the opposite side of the page, thus bringing the ‘Buy Now’ button closer to the end of the user’s scan.</p>

</figure>
<p>After testing to more than 100,000 site visitors, the team found that both designs performed equally. Site visitors clicked ‘Buy Now’ in almost identical frequencies on each of the two versions.</p>
<p>In this case, inconclusive results were actually a win for the team, helping them avoid costly design changes and implementations.</p>
<blockquote  class="full" >
  <p>When you’re working to build a data-driven culture, one of the easiest wins is when you can showcase results really quickly. Optimizely is the best tool out there for that – to go from the point of ideation to the point of validated results. </p>

<h4>TAKEAWAYS</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>UNDERSTAND YOUR AUDIENCE:</em> “We always say that following best practices alone doesn’t guarantee a site’s success; it all depends on a number of factors. The goal of testing is to figure out how a particular audience best responds.” explains Paul. While research suggested site visitors consumed content in the “Z” pattern, testing helped Viget and SB&amp;D discover that this was not the case for their audience.</li>
<li><em>OPTIMIZE CALLS-TO-ACTION:</em> CTAs are often the biggest revenue driver on a website, so it’s important to get them right. Viget found that providing more clarity around Dewalt’s CTAs (‘Buy Now’ and ‘Nearby Retailer’) significantly improved conversions across the website, with a staggering six-figure online revenue improvement from the ‘Buy Now’ test alone.</li>
