<div class="intro">
<p>Code.org is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science education by making it part of the core curriculum in education.</p>
</div>
<p>Code.org’s Founder Hadi Partovi is striving to ensure that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn to code.</p>
<p>Since founding the nonprofit in 2013, Hadi has focused on website optimization as a method garnering support and engaging more teachers and students in Code.org’s campaigns. He hired Roxanne Emadi in September to run testing.</p>
<blockquote  class="full" >
  <p>With Optimizely, we were not only able introduce nearly 1 in 4 U.S. students to computer science, but we were able to launch the fastest growing web service ever, which reached 15 million users in 5 days, faster than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr, combined.</p>
  <div class="attribution">— Roxanne Emandi, Grassroots &amp; Social Strategist, Code.org</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hour of Code campaign aims to introduce millions of students across the country to computer science in just one hour. To say the campaign had a phenomenal turnout rate is an understatement. Code.org signed up 15 million users in five days—over half of which Hadi and Roxanne credit to A/B testing. Here’s how they did it.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-engaging-more-teachers-and-students">Challenge: Engaging More Teachers and Students</h2>
<p>Hadi and Roxanne wanted to improve the CTA and messaging on the Hour of Code registration pages to drive more sign-ups. They hypothesized that messaging that emphasized a sense of community around the movement would encourage greater participation.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-registrations">Optimizing Registrations</h2>
<p>Text on original registration page for the Hour of Code campaign read — “Welcome to the 21st Century. Help us introduce 10 million students to computer science. All it takes is one Hour of Code.”</p>
<p>The original CTA read “Learn more”.</p>
<p>Hadi and Roxanne tested the original messaging against new messaging that emphasized the community aspect. The variation CTA read “Join us”.</p>

<p>RESULTS: The “community-focused” variation lead to a staggering 29% increase in signups for the Hour of Code.Hadi and Roxanne credit this experiment for generating about 8 million student sign-ups to the campaign.</p>

<h1>TESTING TAKEAWAYS:</h1>
<ul>
<li>SMALL CHANGES CAN PRODUCE INCREDIBLE RESULTS: You don’t have to revamp your entire website to achieve your conversion goals. Tweaking four short sentences and a call-to-action generated a huge win for Hadi and Roxanne—helping them reach 8 million additional students with their campaign.
*A/B TESTING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL FOR ANY GROWTH HACKER: Whether you work at non-profit, small business, or global enterprise, chances are you want to increase efficiency to achieve (and surpass) business goals. Website optimization with Optimizely is quick and easy – saving you time and helping you maximize your reach.</li>
