## Introduction

With 1.2 million apps in the Apple Store and 1.3 from Android, it can be hard to stand out. And first impressions are only the beginning, considering that 80-90% of downloaded apps get used once and then deleted.

Today, best-in-class apps are meticulously focused on building lasting relationships with their users. Users who love an app–those with a deep level of engagement on a regular basis–are more likely to rate, recommend, and pay for its services. A highly engaged user base is invaluable to your app’s success.

So how do you create an app users love? One that engages them, delights them, and keeps them coming back for more? It’s all about delivering optimized experiences at every tap along the way. We’ve created this guide to help you do just that.

**Inside, you’ll learn:**

- How to create an unforgettable first impression and improve user acquisition via app store optimization
- Tips for getting users to share the love, with positive reviews, ratings, and social shares
- How to take action and deploy changes more quickly than ever before, with a new approach to the app store review process
- Winning approaches to user onboarding flow and user experience
- More ways to continue engagement with push notification and messages

## How to A/B Test Your Mobile App

Mobile A/B testing is the process of running a controlled experiment comparing one or more variations of an app against the original, with the goal of improving a specific metric, such as taps, engagement, or in-app purchases. The experiment is delivered to a selected percentage of the application’s install base. App users are randomly distributed between the original and variation experiences without knowing they are part of a test. Once a statistically significant difference in user behavior emerges, the results of each variation are compared to determine which performed best against the predetermined goal.

> This method can be used to test changes across any aspect of an application where a measurable goal can be improved, including user interface (UI), onboarding flow, content and messaging, and many more. For example, testing changes to
an app’s first time user experience, or onboarding flow, would help determine what factors improve conversions through each step of the onboarding process and will lead to increased retention over time.

Within your app, nearly every element can be altered, tested, and measured with the goal of improving conversions.

Teams who focus on experience optimization can operate more quickly and efficiently than ever before. After collecting information about users, they can deploy immediate changes to their app, without waiting on the app store review process
or other barriers. Testing and optimization ensures team members focus their time building experiences that are proven to convert. Plus, it’s easy to demonstrate return on investment (ROI), because tests are created with a quantifiable goal in mind and results are easy to track and measure.
