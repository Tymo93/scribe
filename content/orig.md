## Introduction

With 1.2 million apps in the Apple Store and 1.3 from Android, it can be hard to stand out. And first impressions are only the beginning, considering that 80-90% of downloaded apps get used once and then deleted.

Today, best-in-class apps are meticulously focused on building lasting relationships with their users. Users who love an app–those with a deep level of engagement on a regular basis–are more likely to rate, recommend, and pay for its services. A highly engaged user base is invaluable to your app’s success.
