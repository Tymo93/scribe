Optimization was the name of the game for the Obama Digital team. We optimized just about everything from web pages to emails. Overall we executed about 500 a/b tests on our web pages in a 20 month period which increased donation conversions by 49% and sign up conversions by 161%. As you might imagine this yielded some fascinating findings on how user behavior is influenced by variables like design, copy, usability, imagery and page speed.

One was inspired by restaurant menu psychology. One of our team members learned that high end restaurants remove dollar signs from their menus because people tend to spend more money that way. So we removed the dollar sign from our donate page. *The result was a statistical tie.*

Another surprising test was on our mobile website. We thought keeping the form as simple as possible and removing all unnecessary elements would be best so we decided to remove the image of the President since it isnâ€™t essential to the donation. But when we added the photo of the president we got a 6.9% lift using Optimizely as an AB testing tool.
