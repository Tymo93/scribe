[[intro]]

The Swiss Ringier Group, which pro­duces over 120 news­papers and mag­a­zines, runs sev­eral ra­dio and TV stations and well over 80 web and mo­bile plat­forms in 14 coun­tries, has ventured into uncharted territory: Editorial A/B testing.

[[/]]

Testing at Ringier allows the media organization to build a data-driven testing muscle. For one month, a team of editors, product managers and web analysts started three article experiments every day with Optimizely and tested several teaser images, headlines and sub-headlines against each other. The results were an average increase in CTR of almost 20% and almost 5% more page impressions per visitor.
