Website redesigns can be hugely impactful for businesses and other organizations. There are cases all over the internet of site redesigns causing massive drop-offs in visitors and conversion rates. 

When the time came for soccerloco to redesign their website, they turned to optimization to ensure that their new design improved revenue and generated positive ROI. They also partnered with Digital Operative, a digital marketing agency with an e-commerce focus, to help guide the process.

Soccerloco’s primary goal for the redesign was to improve site usability and ultimately increase conversions. With these goals in mind, they started by examining the site analytics to identify areas to focus on in the redesign tests. They generated a detailed, page-by-page analysis of the site and recommendations for areas to optimize.

The homepage and checkout funnel were two areas focus areas. Here’s what they tested.

## Test 1: Homepage

They experimented with simplifying the homepage carousel, using one main promotional image instead of four rotating modules. The winning variation proved that fewer options would ultimately push more visitors down the funnel.

## Test 2: Checkout

They also tested layout on the first page in the checkout funnel. Instead of radio buttons to select your preferred checkout method, Digital Operative suggested making the options more defined calls to action. Larger call to action buttons increased clicks in this case, making a better user experience for shoppers.

## Results

Through this process of discovery and analysis, not only did they increase projected revenue by 26%, all in all, the additional revenue from the Optimizely experiments actually covered the full cost of the redesign process.

The soccerloco redesign is another great example of using data to make informed decision about each element of a redesign. Since realizing the impact that testing instincts and hypotheses about site design can have on revenue, testing and optimization has become a part of how soccerloco frames conversations around design changes and decisions.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Plan to Optimize Throughout a Redesign 

Iterative testing can help to inform a website redesign, providing valuable information to help ensure that the final product is an improvement over the previous design.

### Focus on High-Impact Conversions 

In the case of soccerloco, both the homepage and checkout were extremely high potential areas to test. The checkout pages are close to the ultimate conversion goal for the site, and can measure improvements in revenue from increased conversions. Homepage testing can generate experiment results quickly due to exposure to a high volume of visitor traffic.
