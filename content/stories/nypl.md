[[intro]]

With 100 years of existence, 88 different lending libraries, and four research facilities throughout Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx, the New York Public Library has a lot, a lot, of content. Making patrons aware of this content collected over the last century is a major goal for the library.

One way they achieve this goal is with an opt-in email newsletter. 

Faced with the concern that they were missing out on lucrative email sign ups because of the form’s design, they could have made any number of assumptions to improve it. But they didn’t. Instead, they made a full testing plan and proved — with data — that a specific treatment of the form outperformed the rest. Watch the video to learn how the NYPL doubled their email signups by testing an image with the exact same text.
