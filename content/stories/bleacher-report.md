[[intro]]

Bleacher Report is a sports media brand, in a race to become the ‘ESPN of digital’. One of their key strategies to growth is optimization. By focusing on optimizing social engagement, they were able to convert fairweather sports readers into habitual users that would return to Bleacher Report online and engage through their mobile app.

The Bleacher Report team has spent the last year iterating over various redesigns to their social media popups. Using Optimizely, they were able to quickly test new versions of their promos and monitor their effects on conversion rates. This ultimately led to a complete redesign of their social promos from an intrusive popup to a more subtle flyin, increasing impressions and a *boosting social conversions a whopping 764%*.
