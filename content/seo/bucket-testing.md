Bucket testing (sometimes referred to as A/B testing or split testing) is a term used to describe the method testing two versions of a website against one another to see which one performs better on specified key metrics (such as clicks, downloads or purchases).

There are at least two variations in each test, a Variation A and a Variation B. Metrics from each page variation are measured and visitors are randomly placed into respective ‘buckets’ where the data can be recorded and analyzed to determine which performs best.

Companies that market and sell products or services online rely on bucket testing to help them maximize revenue by optimizing their websites and landing pages for conversions.
